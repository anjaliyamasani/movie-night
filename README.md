MOVIE NIGHT
Movie Recommendation Web App
This is a movie recommendation web app that takes a movie title as input and returns posters of 12 similar movies based on a cosine similarity algorithm. The app is built using Flask for the backend and React for the frontend, and it uses a set of movie tags to identify and recommend similar movies.

Current Features
Movie Search: Users can input a movie title, and the app will recommend 12 similar movies.
Cosine Similarity Algorithm: The recommendation system is based on movie tags and computes the cosine similarity to suggest relevant movies.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works across various screen sizes.
